## Result Interpretation
Now that we have our customer segments, we proceed to the vital step of discussing results with the marketing team and formulating an effective marketing strategy.

### Segments Analysis
*   Twitter Devotees Segment
    *   **Observations:** 58
    *   **Recommendation:** Considering the small size of this segment, we suggest reducing spending on Twitter to a minimum. The results indicate unsatisfactory outcomes, possibly due to recent platform turmoil. We recommend exploring early adoption of a new competitor platform, such as Threads.

*   Facebook Enthusiasts Segment
    *   **Observations:** Close to 8% of all customers
    *   **Characteristics:** Although not the most significant segment, this group demonstrates high dedication to learning with an average watch time exceeding 2,700 minutes.
    *   **Recommendation:** Despite average spending in the lower half, it would be valuable to explore why this group is more motivated to study. This could be the focus of a dedicated analysis on engagement.

### Performance by Region
*   Anglo-Saxon Channel
    *   **Observations:** Largest customer segment from the USA, Canada, the UK, and Australia.
    *   **Insight:** This channel shows the best overall performance.

*   Google-YouTube Mix
    *   **Observations:** Second largest segment, with over 900 customers from the Anglo-Saxon region.
    *   **Insight:** Considerable performance, especially in the Anglo-Saxon region.

*   Rest of the World
    *   **Observations:** Over 60% of customers, with diverse geographical distribution.
    *   **Insight:** Explore how these students interact with the platform and consider tailored engagement strategies.

*   Western Europe
    *   **Observations:** Fewest customers but highest Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
    *   **Insight:** Marketing efforts in Western Europe are insufficient; improving performance is crucial.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis
*   High-Paying Clusters: Anglo-Saxon Multichannel and European Multichannel
    *   **Recommendation:** Focus on Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn as acquisition channels for these regions. Increase spending as the CLV of customers from these clusters is the highest across segments.

*   Remaining Regions and Acquisition Channels
    *   **Rest of the World:**
        *   **Successful Channel:** LinkedIn, followed by Facebook.
        *   **Recommendation:** LinkedIn is an effective platform for attracting customers from these regions due to excellent organic reach.
